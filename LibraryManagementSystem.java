//Creating a Library Management System using Java


//Using LinkedList, HashMap, and Binary Search Tree to create the application
// Implement a linked list to manage the list of books borrowed by a user.
// Implement a hash table(HashMap) to allow quick lookups of books by title or author
// Implement a BST to store Book objects, where the bookID is the key for ordering the books.
